```php
public static function CondorcetElectionFormat::createFromElection( CondorcetPHP\Condorcet\Election $election, [ bool $aggregateVotes = true, bool $includeSeatsToElect = true, bool $includeTags = true, bool $inContext = false, ?SplFileObject $file = null ] ): ?string
```

## Description
Create a CondorcetElectionFormat file from an Election object.

## Parameters

### **election:**
```php
CondorcetPHP\Condorcet\Election $election
```
**Type:** [`CondorcetPHP\Condorcet\Election`](../../../../Election/class_Election.md)

Election with data.

### **aggregateVotes:**
```php
bool $aggregateVotes = true
```
**Type:** `bool`

If true, will try to reduce number of lines, with quantifier for identical votes.

### **includeSeatsToElect:**
```php
bool $includeSeatsToElect = true
```
**Type:** `bool`

Add the Number Of Seats parameters to the output.

### **includeTags:**
```php
bool $includeTags = true
```
**Type:** `bool`

Add the vote tags information if any. Not working if $aggregateVotes is true.

### **inContext:**
```php
bool $inContext = false
```
**Type:** `bool`

Non-election candidates will be ignored. If the implicit ranking parameter of the election object is true, the last rank will also be provided to facilitate the reading.

### **file:**
```php
?SplFileObject $file = null
```
**Type:** `?SplFileObject`

If provided, the function will return null and the result will be writing directly to the file instead. _Note that the file cursor is not rewinding_.

## Return
**Type:** `?string`

If the file is not provided, it's return a CondorcetElectionFormat as string, else returning null and working directly on the file object (necessary for very large non-aggregated elections, at the risk of memory saturation).
