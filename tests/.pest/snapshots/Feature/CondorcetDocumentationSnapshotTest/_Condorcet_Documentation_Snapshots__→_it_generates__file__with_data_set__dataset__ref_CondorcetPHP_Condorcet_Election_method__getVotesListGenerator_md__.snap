> [Read it at source](https://github.com/julien-boudry/Condorcet/blob/master/src/ElectionProcess/VotesProcess.php#L190)

```php
public function Election->getVotesListGenerator( [ array|string|null $tags = null, bool $with = true ] ): Generator
```

## Description
Same as Election::getVotesList. But returns a PHP generator object.

Useful if you work on very large elections with an external DataHandler, because it will not use large amounts of memory.

## Parameters

### **tags:**
```php
array|string|null $tags = null
```
**Type:** `array` | `string` | `?null`

Tags list as a string separated by commas or array.

### **with:**
```php
bool $with = true
```
**Type:** `bool`

Get votes with these tags or without.

## Return
**Type:** `Generator`

Populated by each Vote object.
